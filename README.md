# ATS System - Resume Matching Application

## üìã Project Overview

This is an intelligent **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** that uses AI to analyze resumes against job descriptions. The system provides detailed feedback on resume quality, keyword matching, and compatibility with job requirements.

## üöÄ Features

- **PDF Resume Processing**: Supports both text-based and image-based PDFs
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Groq's LLaMA 3.3 70B model for intelligent analysis
- **Dual Extraction Methods**: Direct text extraction + OCR fallback for scanned PDFs
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy use
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides percentage match, missing keywords, and recommendations

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### Step 1: PDF Upload and Processing
1. User uploads a PDF resume through the web interface
2. System attempts direct text extraction using PyMuPDF
3. If no text found, falls back to OCR using Tesseract
4. Extracted text is stored for analysis

### Step 2: Job Description Input
1. User enters job description in the text area
2. System combines job description with extracted resume text

### Step 3: AI Analysis
1. System sends combined data to Groq AI (LLaMA 3.3 70B)
2. AI analyzes resume against job requirements
3. Returns detailed feedback including:
   - Resume strengths and weaknesses
   - Percentage match with job description
   - Missing keywords
   - Final recommendations

### Step 4: Results Display
1. System displays AI analysis results
2. User can view extracted text preview
3. Results include actionable insights for improvement

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
2. **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction from images
3. **Poppler** for PDF to image conversion
4. **Groq API Key** for AI analysis

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
